I'm Abdullah, a high school student with a strong interest in math, data, and how things work. I study advanced math on my own, including calculus and linear algebra, and use Python for data analysis and machine learning. I also compete in DECA and math team, where I've placed at the state and international levels.

I build tools that solve real problems, like helping students find internships or improve their resumes. I'm learning by doing and looking for chances to work on projects, research, or internships in math, data science, or finance. I'm focused, curious, and serious about getting better at what I do. Feel free to reach out.
